<h1>Samantha Frech</h1>
<p>Hi! I am currently a student at the University of Michigan double majoring in Data Science and Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience with a minor in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences. I am graduating this coming May 2025, taking a two week trip to Europe with my roommate and my sister, and then hope to start a full-time position soon after. I think creating good data visualiations is crucial for understanding data trends and am therefore super excited for this class!</p>

<h2> SI 649: Visualizations </h2>
<p>The following visualizations were created as part of the course SI 649.</p>
<img src="task1bechdel.png" alt="How films have performed on the Bechdel test over time. Although the percentage of films passing the Bechdel test have plateaued over the past few decades, there's still a greater percentage passing today than in 1970.">
